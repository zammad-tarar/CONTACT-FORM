  - A required field has been missed.
  - The email address is not formatted correctly.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript for form validation

### What I Learned

This project helped me reinforce my knowledge of:

- Building accessible forms.
- Using semantic HTML for better user experience.
- Implementing client-side form validation with JavaScript.
- Creating responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

Hereâ€™s a snippet of my form validation code:

```js
const form = document.getElementById('contact-form');
form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  // Validate form inputs
});
```

### Continued Development

I plan to:

- Improve the formâ€™s accessibility by ensuring it works seamlessly with screen readers.
- Implement server-side validation for enhanced security.
- Experiment with different form UI enhancements.
